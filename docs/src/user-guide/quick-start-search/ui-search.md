# Searching from the UI

* Open the UI and navigate to the search page by clicking the üîç Search button in the sidebar on the
  left.
* You can enter a query in the text box at the top of the search page.
    * The format of a query depends on the format of your logs: see [JSON](json-search) or
      [text](text-search).
* To narrow your search to a specific time range or perform case-sensitive searches, click the
  hamburger icon to the left of the text box and use the appropriate controls.

:::{note}
By default, the UI will only return 1,000 of the latest search results. To perform searches which
return more results, use the [command line](cli-search.md).
